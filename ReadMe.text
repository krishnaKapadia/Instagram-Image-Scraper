This small script is used to scrape Instagram photos from a specified user's account.
However it is only able to get the first 12, as this only scraped the images that
are available directly after a page reload, e.g only the first 12 photos are loaded.

This does not work on private account as private accounts do not have their img url's
publicly available even through directly outputting all scraped info to json and
paring through here. The user must supply the target account name, the database
information is hard coded, however could be passed through at a later time.
